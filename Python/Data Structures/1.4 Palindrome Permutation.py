"""
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word
or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The 
palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input:  Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
